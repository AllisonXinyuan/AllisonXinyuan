# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Allison (Xinyuan) Zhang ðŸ‘‹

Right after university, I co-founded Tatto, a location-based social app in London. Now Iâ€™m a seed investor focused on early-stage AI â€” especially AI applications, agent infra, and robotics.

Iâ€™m committed to the open-source community and co-founded EvalSys, where we shipped MCP Mark and are currently exploring multi-agent systems.

On the side, I run my own quant strategies and have been trading digital assets since 2014.

Outside of work, I enjoy rock climbing, anime, and playing the Guqin (a traditional Chinese instrument).

I split my time between Palo Alto and Beijing, and Iâ€™m always happy to meet new friends â€” whether youâ€™re building in AI, into trading, or curious about EvalSys.
