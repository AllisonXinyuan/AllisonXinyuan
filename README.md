Hi, Iâ€™m Allison Xinyuan Zhang!

I started out as an entrepreneur:after graduation I co-founded Tatto, a location-based social app.

Iâ€™m deeply committed to the open-source community. I co-founded EvalSys, a living, open-source community to track and advance model agentic capabilities. Weâ€™re building benchmarks, datasets, toolchains, and models to help push the field forward.

Currently, Iâ€™m a seed investor focused on early-stage AI, with strong interests in AI applications, agentic infrastructure, and robotics.

Iâ€™m also an amateur trader and cryptography enthusiast, running my own quant strategies â€” Iâ€™ve been trading digital assets since 2014.

Beyond work, I enjoy rock climbing, anime, and I studied the guqin (a traditional Chinese instrument) for twelve years.

Looking forward to connecting!
