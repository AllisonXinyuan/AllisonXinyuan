# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, Iâ€™m Allison Xinyuan Zhan!

I began my career as an entrepreneur â€” right after graduation, I co-founded Tatto, a location-based social app.

Iâ€™m deeply committed to the open-source community. I co-founded EvalSys, a living, open-source community dedicated to tracking and advancing model agentic capabilities. Weâ€™re building benchmarks, datasets, toolchains, and models to help push the field forward.

Currently, Iâ€™m a seed investor focused on early-stage AI, with particular interest in AI applications, agentic infra, and robotics. I aim to be the first partner to startup teamsâ€”not just an investor, but someone who builds and codes alongside them.

Iâ€™m also an amateur trader and cryptography enthusiast, running my own quant strategies. Iâ€™ve been trading digital assets since 2014.

Outside of work, I enjoy rock climbing, anime, and playing the Guqin (a traditional Chinese instrument Iâ€™ve been studying for over twenty years).

Looking forward to connecting! ðŸ“§ xinyuanyy@gmail.com
